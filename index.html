    <h1>Flux - Static Site Generator</h1>
    <p>
        Flux is an simple Static Site Generator written in Go programming language. It's a single binary file that generates HTML content from markdown files.
        This site generated using Flux itself.
    </p>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>
        This is a personal project, build for my personal use. I wanted Flux to be simple, lightweight and not too bloated with features.
        I have used Jekyll in the past and few of the concepts are borrowed from it directly. Folder structure is quire similar.
        However there is one major difference, that is every post is encapsulated inside a folder, which contains markdown as well other assets like 
        images and videos used in that post. This decluters the assets folder, which is only used to store and refer site related files.
        Templating engine is very similar to Django templates in syntax, with some prefined filters.
        <span>Flux uses a global config file, that defines the site's metadata as well user defined data, that can be used throughout the site.</span>
        <span>Flux also supports an in-built http file server, that servers the generated content and triggers the build process again, if there is any file change.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is the complete list of features supported in version 1.0 of Flux.
        <ul>
            <li>Using Markdown for blog posts</li>
            <li>Using front matter for Markdown files</li>
            <li>Syntax highlighting</li>
            <li>Support for Django style templates</li>
            <li>Live reloading with http server</li>
            <li>Support for Sass</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
