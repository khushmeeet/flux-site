    <h1 class="header-font">Flux Â· Static Site Generator</h1>
    <p>
        Flux is an simple Static Site Generator written in Go programming language. It's a single binary file that generates HTML content from markdown files.
        This site generated using Flux itself.
    </p>
    <h3 class="header-font">Features</h3>
    <p>
        This is a personal project, build for my personal use. I wanted Flux to be simple, lightweight and not too bloated with features.
        I have used Jekyll in the past and few of the concepts are borrowed from it directly. Folder structure is quire similar.
        However there is one major difference, that is every post is encapsulated inside a folder, which contains markdown as well other assets like 
        images and videos used in that post. This decluters the assets folder, which is only used to store and refer site related files.
        Templating engine is very similar to Django templates in syntax, with some prefined filters.
    </p>
    <p>Flux uses a global config file, that defines the site's metadata as well user defined data, that can be used throughout the site.</p>
    <p>Flux also supports an in-built http file server, that servers the generated content and triggers the build process again, if there is any file change.</p>
    <p>
        Here is the complete list of features supported in version 1.0 of Flux.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using Markdown for blog posts</li>
        <li>Using front matter for Markdown files</li>
        <li>Syntax highlighting</li>
        <li>Support for Django style templates</li>
        <li>Live reloading with http server</li>
        <li>Support for Sass</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="header-font">Current Progress and Future Updates</h3>
    <p>
        Flux is a site project, and so there are no guarantee how the development progresses with time. Right now flux is a basic static site engine,
        with minimal required functionality to create personal web pages and blogs. more features are planned, but there is no timeline on when those feature will arive.
        But to name some of the functionality planned in next Updates
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>RSS generator</li>
        <li>Sitemap generator</li>
        <li>Pug templating for HTML</li>
        <li>Support structured content</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Supporting first two features are in progress. However for the other two, there is no plan, as they are not useful in my projects, so their priority is lot less.
        But if you want to contribute to the project, create an <a href="https://github.com/khushmeeet/flux/issues">issue</a> and we can discuss about it.
